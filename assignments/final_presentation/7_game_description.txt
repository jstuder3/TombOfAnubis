Tomb of Anubis is couch-coop game in which you play as explorers that discover a treasure inside a newly found opening in one of the Pyramids of Giza.
By taking some of the treasure, you desecrate the grave and thereby unleash the wrath of Anubis, the protector of graves.
Your goal is to find powerful artefacts which are able to entomb Anubis.
While navigating through a labyrinth consisting of corridors and chambers, you will encounter traps and obstacles that require cooperation.
Can you find all of the artefacts before Anubis finds you?
