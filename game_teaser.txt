Title: Tomb of Anubis

You are a group of explorers that found a new entrance to the Great Pyramid of Giza. Inside, you find a treasure. By taking it, you awaken Anubis from his slumber. You now have to find a way to lock him up again. By navigating a maze, dodging traps, cooperating and collecting artefacts, you work towards entombing Anubis again.
